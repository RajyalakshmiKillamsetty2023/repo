<p>Computer is an electronic device that can perform a variety of operations in accordance with a set of instructions called <b>program</b>.It processes the input data given by the user and provides the desired output.</p>
<br>
<h2>Central Processing Unit(CPU)</h2>
<p>Central Processing Unit is a main component of computer, or known as the brain of the computer which performs all the processing of theinput data.Its function is to execute the instructions stored inthe main memory of a computer.Im <b>microcomputers</b>,the CPU is built on a single chip that is the <b>intrgrated circuit(IC)</b> and is the mcroprocessor.THE CPU consists of ALU,Control Unit,Registers,Buses and the Clock.</p>
<br>
The internal components of the CPU are:
<ol>
<li><h3>Arithemetic Logic Unit:</h3>
	<p>The arithemetic logic unit of CPU is responsible for all the arithemetic operations like addition,subtraction,multiplictaion and divison as well as it adds a logic to the operations that we perform.</p></li>
<li><h3>Control Unit:</h3>
<p>The control unit is responsible for the controlling and the transfer of data and the execution of all the instrucions among other units of a computer.It is considered to be the Centarl Nervous System of the computer,as it manages and coordinates all the units of the computer.It obtains the instructions from the memory,interprets them and directs the operations of the computer.It also performs the physical data transfer between memory and the peripheral devices.</p></li>
